# LISP Checker
LISP Checker is a small project that checks whether the parentheses in an input string are properly closed and nested. LISP Checker will print 'true' to the console if input string is correct and 'false' if incorrect.
	
## Execution
To run the project, compile LispChecker.java in src/ and execute from command line with the input string as argument.
	
Example: java LispChecker "a + (b + c)"
